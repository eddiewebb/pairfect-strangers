I mean the idea is :100:, obviously.

But the execution has room.  Help me add more dynamic aspects like in-app communication, matching, etc.

### Me
Practiced web service developer, mostly Java.  


### Where
https://github.com/eddiewebb/pairfect-strangers

### How
Hangouts, Slack, Zoom, whatever. Please open issue at the repo and we can coordinate time.


### Technology
I'm open, but given low adoption initally, a lightweight web-app could be done standalone or as functions/api hooks that would integtate well with jamstack.

Using CI/CD in CircleCI to deliver.
